## üîç Why Study the OSI Model?

We use the **TCP/IP model** in real networks, but the **OSI model** is still important because:

- It is a **common guide** to understand networking.
- It helps to **find and fix problems** step-by-step.
- It gives **clear terms** for all network engineers.
- It shows the **big picture** of how data moves.

OSI is like a **blueprint**, TCP/IP is the **actual system** we use.

## üìä OSI vs TCP/IP Mapping

| OSI Layer               | TCP/IP Equivalent |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 7. Application          | Application       |
| 6. Presentation         | Application       |
| 5. Session              | Application       |
| 4. Transport            | Transport         |
| 3. Network              | Internet          |
| 2. Data Link            | Network Access    |
| 1. Physical             | Network Access    |

**Tip:** To remember the OSI layers, use:  
**"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"** (Application ‚Üí Physical).
